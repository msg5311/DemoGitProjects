# Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

This is the place that I will be posting personal projects and work products for my own benefit. My educational background is in Industrial Engineering, but I have split my professional career between consulting and data analytics. I pride myself on always looking for ways to apply my technical skills, but also in being able to effectively communicate complex findings to stakeholders and focus on the business impact.

I am always working on projects in my free time and do my best to keep this TOC up to date. Some projects may overlap skillsets, in that event I will direct the hyperlink to the relevant skill.

### Python projects:

#### The Dinner Party:

[SQL code](https://github.com/msg5311/DemoGitProjects/blob/main/Dinner%20Party/GoodreadsUpload.sql)

**Premise:** Use data analytics to determine which books to read in order to maximize conversations at a dinner party. The dataset utiized was sourced from Goodreads and represented the most read and rated books published since 1980. SQL was used for the majority of the data cleaning and transformations. Once the data was fitlered down, and in a usable format, I was able to export and build a dashboard in Tableau and solve the objective function, within the constraints. 

**Skills:** split_part, ranking, inner join

**Technology:** Tableau, SQL

#### Ingredient import:

[SQL code](https://github.com/msg5311/DemoGitProjects/blob/main/MEP/ingredient_import_sp.sql)

**Premise:** As part of an extensive personal project to create a cooking database, this project focuses on automating the upload of new ingredients to the database.

#### Fantasy Football Statistics:

[SQL code](https://github.com/msg5311/DemoGitProjects/blob/main/NYJ/NYJ_combined_stats.sql)

**Premise:** This was my first project in SQL and meant to create a dataset from scratch, build tables, and perform light transformations. Data for this project was sourced from ESPN.

**Skills:** Creating tables, altering tables, inserting data, creating columns with default values, updating values based on critera and formulas, joins.

**Technology:** SQL

#### Webscraping example:

[Python code](https://github.com/msg5311/DemoGitProjects/blob/main/ws3_tabledata.py)

**Premise:** This short project was to practice webscraping using the BeautifulSoup library. Using a for loop, this script loops through 30 pages of table data and extracts the teams and their respective records by year, then writes it to a CSV file. 

**Skills:** BeautifulSoup, for loops, read/write to CSV

**Technology:** Python
